WallChanger
================

A little program I wrote while teaching myself python.
Automatically fetches a popular image from wallhaven.cc and sets it as the wallpaper every half hour.
Images are stored and checked against to prevent the same image being downloaded twice.
The images are also filtered using a blacklist of undesired tags.

The script use to grab images from wallbase.cc however the site is shutting down. Wallhaven is still in alpha so expect the script to be updated as the site changes.
